# Collaction of small practice projects 

This repostiory is to record the collection of small projects that I built while learning programming languages, to solidfy my understanding and learn more.  

I am not focused on the UI of most projects, I only focused on writing proper Javascript code.

The resources for getting this small projects are  

      1. Geeksforgeeks  
      2. Youtube
